Redirects module for ProcessWire
--------------------------------

This module creates an admin page under Setup > Redirects. This page serves as a list of redirects, and lets you create
individual redirets one by one and import batches of redirects using CSV syntax. Redirects can forward the visitor to
another path or page on your site, as well as an external URL.
